# SUnAA
Sparse Unmixing using Archetypal Analysis (SUnAA) is an innovative semi-supervised unmixing technique that leverages the assumption that real endmembers can be represented as convex combinations of the library endmembers. Building upon the principles of archetypal analysis, we propose a new model formulation for sparse unmixing. The motivation behind this method is to address mismatches commonly encountered between endmembers from spectral libraries and endmembers from a dataset, which often manifest as scaling factors. These mismatches can arise from various sources such as noise, atmospheric effects, illumination variations, and the intrinsic variability of materials. In contrast to conventional sparse unmixing methods, SUnAA estimates both the endmembers and abundances by utilizing the endmember library as a reference.
